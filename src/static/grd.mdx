GitHub repository information gleaned from assisting a friend in learning Redux. I was also a novice at the moment, so we fell into a lot of trouble figuring things out on a live call. I remember thinking about how to make use of Firebase. The docs weren't as explanatory as we wanted them to be. I moved back and forth between different YouTube tutorials and GitHub repositories just to be able to get where the project is today. This project is a milestone in my learning process. I worked with tools that weren't just for composing user interfaces (UI) alone but for managing state and authentication as well. With this project, I gained confidence in my skills.

## Lessons Learned

- **Authentication**: I learned how authentication works and implemented it in React with Firebase.
- **Envirmontal Variables**: To protect my firebase identity from hackers ,I used environmental variables.
- **Data Fetching with Redux**: I had a fun experience fetching data without using useEffects. I simply called my predefined hooks. It also made it easy to handle errors and load states.
- **You Learn by Teaching Others**: I probably wouldn't know redux if I hadn't tried to teach it. Teaching someone really made me learn more about from their questions and responses.
