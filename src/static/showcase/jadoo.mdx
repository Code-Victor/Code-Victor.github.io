I'm a curious person , I also love exploring as search for ideas to implement in Code. One of my Journeys lead me here.
I found a freebie by AR shakir a ui/ux designer particular about landing pages and dashboards. It was a full page design but without the mobile view.
After thinking of it for a moment, I decided to get it a try and here it is -- Jadoo landing page. I added a few personal touch to the design like animations.
but the most challenging peice was the responsiveness, and I did it the best I can.

## Lessons Learned

- **Animations are important**: adding animations to your website, as subtle as they might be, eventually add up to make an awesome user interface.
- **Fast Page Load**: by using Next.js I was able to increase my page load time and SEO( confirmed by Lighthouse).
- **Responsiveness**: I started developing for the desktop view without thinking much of the mobile view. this came by to haunting me.I should have done the mobile view before starting
