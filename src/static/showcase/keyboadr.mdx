As a beginner software developer, I was always facinated by how senior developers
wrote code very fast. I began searching for ways to learn to write code faster and
I found this [typing Club](https://keyboardr.com) website. the website was so ground
to earth and as I went through it I moved from about 24 wpm to about 60 wpm with
a month. I couldn't hide this acheivement I just kept on telling everyone about it.
Months later, I began thinking of a projects to build. I didn't want to build generic
projects. I wanted somethng unique , something I would love to use for myself.Then
I came up with Keyboadr a website to learn/practice keyboarding.

- Fetching strings to type from a quotes api.
- Typing speed is calculated and displayed

## Future plans

- Ability to save your progress and load it back in

## Lessons Learned

- **CSS Grid**: I was able to build the keyboard layout without using an svg all with CSS grid. It was a great learning experience.
  I add to make sure each item iteracted well with it's peers, or else the keyboard layout falls apart.
- **Data Fetching**: I was able to fetch data conditionally with useEffects only when the data is need and store them in states to ensure the dynamic rendering of the new data.
- **Optimization is Key!**: Completing the project I was shocked to see the keyboard layout rendering everytime my counter increases. I was able to optimize the code by using hooks and memoization.

<Caption caption="optimizing the keyboard component">

```jsx {2,11} showLineNumbers
//keyboard.jsx
export default React.memo(Keyboard, areEqual);

//App.jsx
import Keyboard from "./keyboard";

export default App=()=>{
  //...
  <div className="App">
    {/*other code*/}
    <Keyboard />
  </div>
};
```

- Search Engine Optimization: I worked extensively on the head tag to insure better
Search engine optimization.
