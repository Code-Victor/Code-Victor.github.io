      "I started learning python in the year 2020 at <a href='https://www.datasciencenigeria.org/' target='_blank'>Data Scientist Network</a> Lagos, where I was taught its application in  machine learning. I learned to build a simple text classifier with Scikit-Learn(a python ML library). With these skills, I was able to do python challenges on <a href='https://www.hackerrank.com/hamzatoluwabori' target='_blank'>Hackerrank</a> and solve ML problems like this <a href='https://github.com/Code-Victor/Imdb-Rating-Prediction' target='_blank'>IMDb rating prediction</a> and a <a href='https://github.com/Code-Victor/YoutubeDownloader' target='_blank'>python helper to download youtube videos</a>",

      "With the help of <a href='http://www.freecodecamp.org/' target='_blank'>Freecodecamp.org</a> and lots of youtube videos, I was able to gain a firm grasp of building user interfaces with Html and CSS.

After mastering Javascript, I was able to add interactivity to my apps which made it easier to build more complex apps like <a href='https://code-victor.github.io/crowdfunding-product-page/' target='_blank'>Crowdfunding product page </a>and <a  href='https://code-victor.github.io/insure-landing-page/' target='_blank'>Insure landing page</a>",
